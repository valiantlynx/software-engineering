- The **responsibility** for each class follows the **Single Responsibility Principle** to ensure that every class has a focused role in the system.

These CRC cards provide a comprehensive view of each class in the system, detailing not only what each class does but also how it interacts with other parts of the system. This will be useful when designing the overall system architecture and ensuring that all parts fit together in a well-defined, modular fashion. 


### **Step 8: Documenting the Use of SOLID Principles**
In Step 8, we document how **SOLID principles** have been incorporated into the system design to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Below, I will describe how each principle has been applied across the classes and packages designed in the previous steps.

#### **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
**SRP** states that each class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should only have one responsibility. Here's how SRP is applied throughout the system:

- **User Management**:
  - The **User** class is responsible only for storing common attributes and handling login functionality. Specialized classes like **Patient**, **Doctor**, and **Administrator** extend **User** and have unique responsibilities specific to their roles.
  - The **SessionManager** is solely responsible for managing user sessions, including creating and validating them.
- **Medical Record Management**:
  - The **MedicalRecord** class handles storing and updating patient medical data.
  - Separate classes like **Prescription** and **TestResult** are used to manage specific types of medical information, ensuring that **MedicalRecord** does not grow overly complex.
- **Billing and Payments**:
  - The **Billing** class is responsible for generating and storing billing information, while the **Payment** class handles the payment process itself.
  - The **PaymentGateway** interface abstracts external payment processing.
  
By adhering to SRP, the system ensures that each class is easy to understand and maintain, reducing the risk of changes affecting unrelated functionality.

#### **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
**OCP** states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means we should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.

- **NotificationService**:
  - The **NotificationService** class is designed to be easily extended to add new notification methods (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications). If a new notification type is added, it can be done by extending the notification mechanism, rather than modifying the existing code.
- **User Roles**:
  - The **User** class is a base class that is extended by **Patient**, **Doctor**, and **Administrator**. New roles can be added by creating new subclasses without modifying the **User** class itself.
- **Appointment Scheduling**:
  - The **Schedule** class can be extended to include new appointment-related functionalities (e.g., rescheduling, appointment reminders) without modifying the core functionality.

By adhering to OCP, the system supports adding new features or extending existing ones without risking regression in existing features, thereby maintaining stability.

#### **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
**LSP** states that derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program. Here's how LSP is applied:

- **User Subclasses**:
  - The **Patient**, **Doctor**, and **Administrator** classes all inherit from **User** and can be used in any context where **User** is expected. Each derived class extends the **User** class without changing its behavior.
- **NotificationService**:
  - If we have derived classes such as **EmailNotificationService** and **SMSNotificationService**, they can be used interchangeably in place of **NotificationService** wherever needed, ensuring consistent behavior.

By applying LSP, the system ensures that common behavior is preserved across related classes, preventing unexpected issues when substituting derived classes.

#### **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
**ISP** states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. This means creating specific, small interfaces for different functionalities rather than one large general-purpose interface.

- **Payment Gateway**:
  - **PaymentGateway** is an interface that includes only the methods required for processing payments (`authorizePayment()`). Different payment processors can implement this interface according to their requirements without being forced to include unrelated methods.
- **Schedulable Interface**:
  - A **Schedulable** interface could be created for classes like **Patient** and **Doctor** that need scheduling capabilities. This way, other classes that do not need scheduling do not have to implement irrelevant methods.
  
By following ISP, the system ensures that classes are not burdened with methods they do not need, resulting in simpler, more focused class designs.

#### **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
**DIP** states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This reduces the coupling between high-level and low-level modules.

- **PaymentGateway Interface**:
  - The **Payment** class depends on the **PaymentGateway** interface, rather than a specific payment processor implementation. This allows for different payment processors to be integrated without modifying the **Payment** class, thereby ensuring that the **Payment** class is independent of the implementation details of any specific payment processor.
- **NotificationService**:
  - **NotificationService** depends on an abstract mechanism for sending notifications rather than a specific method. This allows new notification channels to be integrated without modifying the core **NotificationService** logic.

By adhering to DIP, the system is more flexible and maintainable, as it is easier to replace or update components without affecting other parts of the system.

### **Summary of Applying SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has a clear, distinct responsibility. This ensures the system is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new features to be added without altering existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses can be substituted for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the application.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Specific, small interfaces are used, ensuring that classes are not forced to implement methods they do not need.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level implementations. Instead, both depend on abstractions, making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

By documenting and incorporating these principles, the system is designed with flexibility, scalability, and maintainability in mind, ensuring that future changes can be implemented with minimal disruption to existing features. This approach also promotes clean code practices, reduces technical debt, and provides a solid foundation for future growth and enhancements.
