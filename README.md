# Software Engineering Overview

## What is Software Engineering?

Software engineering is the structured approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It applies engineering principles to ensure software is reliable, scalable, and meets user needs.

## Key Steps:
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Define what the software should do.
2. **Design**: Plan the system's architecture and structure.
3. **Implementation**: Write the code to build the software.
4. **Testing**: Check for bugs and ensure everything works correctly.
5. **Maintenance**: Update and improve the software as needed.

## Why is it Important?
- Ensures software is high-quality and efficient.
- Helps manage large, complex projects.
- Reduces bugs and long-term costs.

## Common Methodologies:
- **Agile**: Flexible, iterative development.
- **Waterfall**: Linear, step-by-step approach.
- **DevOps**: Combines development and operations for faster delivery.

Software engineering is essential for building reliable and maintainable software that meets the evolving needs of users and businesses.
